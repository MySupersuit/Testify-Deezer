## Technologies
* Android + Kotlin
* First app trying out MVVM architecture
* Retrofit - HTTP API calls
* Room - Local database for caching
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/discover/) and [LastFM Api](https://www.last.fm/api)
  * Last FM was used due to Spotify not providing the number of streams a track has in its API which was weird.
* Google Play Services - Leaderboards and app hosting
